        He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow’s technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a youthful, 
        daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went 
        to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove.

        But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning 
        disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them all 
        of everything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly 
        conduct this burglar into his family’s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon 
        the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shriveled up his home.

        Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was in 
        the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always 
        had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but 
        with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband’s 
        hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, 
        came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor’s iron lullaby, 
        the blacksmith’s infants were rocked to slumber.

        Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst thou 
        taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then had 
        the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable, legendary 
        sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing competency. 
        But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil 
        solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than 
        useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest.

        Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more 
        between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the wife sat frozen 
        at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces 
        of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house 
        was sold; the mother dived down into the long churchyard grass; her children 
        twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off 
        a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!

        Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is only 
        a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but the first salutation 
        to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; 
        therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them 
        some interior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive 
        ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, 
        and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, 
        the thousand mermaids sing to them—

        "Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate 
        death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come hither! bury 
        thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, 
        is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put up thy gravestone, too, within the 
        churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!"

        Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall of eve, 
        the blacksmith’s soul responded, "Aye, I come!" And so Perth went a-whaling.
